o WTA carbohydrate ::: 6

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation ::: 2

o Add anisotropic radius scaling from Claus. Need to check mails or something
  for scaling code. ::: 1

o Rework monomer library usage - make it more like Moorhen. ::: 3

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch ::: 4

o have another look at Rama plot ::: 1
  So far it seems like a driver bug.

o check 2d ligand view on new MacBook Pro. ::: 0.5

--- Other Items ---

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

o Select fitting map should be an overlay, I think. ::: 0.5

o B-factor of atoms around the centre of the screen ::: 1.5
  local_b_factor_display(short int state)
